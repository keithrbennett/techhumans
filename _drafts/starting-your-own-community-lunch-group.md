### My Lunch Story

In 2009, when I was still writing Java software, I decided to start a monthly lunch group in my local area. I figured it would be enjoyable, educational, and I might make some connections that would be useful in my career.

There was already an online discussion group for Java developers in my area, and I was quite active on it, so it was a simple matter of merely making an announcement and see who responded.

More than anything else, it turned out to be the beginning of new friendships. Nine years later, we still meet. Many of us have moved on to other languages and activities, but the connection remains.

As a return on investment, the few minutes a month I spent getting us together was wildly successful. The great thing about lunches like this is that there is virtually no preparation involved. Nor is there any cost, other than the cost of your lunch.

### So What?

Why do I bring this up? Because there have been many times when I've heard stories such as these:

1) My spouse had to move for his/her education/career so we moved to city X. I don't know anyone here. It's lonely and I miss the technical community I had before.

2) I'd really love to go the monthly meetups but I live far from them and due to the traffic it's not practical for me; and yet I would love to partake in some kind of technical community.

3) All the meetups are in the evening when I have take care of my children. Is there no other way to meet my colleagues socially?

4) I've been working on technology X, and have not found any technical community around it. I don't have the time and funds to start a meetup but I'd love to meet other people also working on X.

5) All the meetups in which I'm interested seem to center around alcohol, and I'm not comfortable with that.

6) I work remotely, alone, and need human contact!



### What I've Learned

Here I will share with you what I've learned about what has worked best for us.

##### Venue

The venue can make or break the gathering. Here are some things to consider when deciding on a venue:

* _Variable Attendance_ - it will probably be difficult to predict the number of people who will show up. You'll want a place where they won't bug you about being only two people, but will have the capacity to support your maximum turnout if that number turns up.
* _Reasonable Cost_ - keep in mind that some people have more discretionary funds than others. Your meeting should be financially feasible for as many people as possible, _especially_ those who are not currently in a paying job, who likely want or need to participate more than anyone else.
* _Culinary Diversity_ - it's possible that everyone in your _current_ group will love eating hamburgers and French fries every month, but if that's all your venue serves, you may be excluding new entrants who would otherwise want to join you. In particular, and at the other extreme, many people these days are vegetarian and vegan. It's not enough to serve a hamburger with lettuce and tomato without the hamburger! I've seen other awful imitations of vegetarian food, such as a plate of colorless Iceberg lettuce. But even outside of the red meat vs. vegan divide, there are many tastes that can be accommodated. Try to find a place with diverse offerings, or use multiple venues (see below). This said, I _don't_ recommend a place with a narrow set of choices (e.g. _only_ vegan), because that wouldn't be inclusive either.
* _Cultural Sensitivity_ - taken broadly, this means choosing the venue to be as inclusive as possible. While you are not necessarily responsible to do this at every meeting, it would be nice to select a venue with Chinese or Halal or Kosher food at times, as applicable to your community. (Give plenty of advance notice about this, as the people who care about this may not be expecting it and the added time may be helpful to them.)
* _Low Noise Level_ - some restaurants these days are crazy loud; these are _not_ good places to meet. (I recommend using a sound meter mobile application so someone who checks out a venue in advance can report to the group with an objective measurement). It may be counterintuitive, but some people who are hard of hearing have a much harder time in noisy environments than quiet ones.
* _Table Layout_ - places with round or long tables (or where tables can be moved together) are best, to maximize the number of interactions in the group.
* _Separate Checks_ - nothing kills a group as much as the organizer getting stiffed by people who leave without paying their share of the bill. It's best to choose a place where people will naturally pay separately (for example, a place where you order and pay at the counter), but second best is to inform the group and the venue that there will be separate checks, and (sadly) keep an eye on unfamiliar people.
* _Not Too Crowded_ - it will be easier to accommodate variable numbers of people, and the venue will be more likely to tolerate that variation, if you meet at a time that is not crowded. For example, we avoid Friday. You could also meet at 1:00 instead of noon if necessary.
* _Location Diversity_ - it's likely that your venue will be much more convenient to some of you than to others. You can mitigate this inequality by meeting at multiple venues, perhaps, for example, alternating months at two places.
* _Approachable Management_ - it's not absolutely necessary, but in some cases it can be helpful to cultivate a relationship with the restaurant management. You can speak with the manager in advance and explain your group situation, especially the attendance variability. Then he/she will have the information needed to help you out should you have problems at the time of your meeting. They might also be kind enough to set aside space for your group at future meetings, despite the uncertainty of the numbers. We had one restaurateur reserve his large round table for us at every meeting.
* _Transportation Accessibility_ - it should be near public transportation and/or have adequate parking, as applicable for your community
* _No Time Pressure_ - it should be a place where the staff will not be eager to push you out to make room for other customers
* _Timely Service_ - it's likely that some of you will not have the flexibility to stay there a long time, so you need a place that will not take too long to serve the food.


Here are examples of some places that have worked well for us (we are in the Reston/Herndon, Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC, USA):

* Santini's - not expensive, high quality food, reasonable prices; order and pay at the counter; serves pizzas, calzones, sandwiches, salads; has long tables and is never too crowded for us to all sit together

* Wegman's - a supermarket with a huge variety of high quality prepared foods sold by the pound; expensive, but tables are far from the commercial area and people can bring their own food or not eat at all; very plentiful seating

* Mediterranean Breeze - a Greek restaurant with plentiful seating; not expensive with even less expensive lunch specials; Greek and American offerings; very willing to give us separate checks

If you have a _really_ hard time finding a venue, it's time to start thinking further outside the box -- a hospital cafeteria, a public park, a train station, a group member's home or backyard...

Don't be concerned about large size. Quality of interactions is optimal where there is one conversation, and the maximum for that is about 8 people.

If a large group, and practical, feel free to move around.

Ask for help, for information, job leads, etc.
