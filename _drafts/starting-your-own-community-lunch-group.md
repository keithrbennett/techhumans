title: Starting Your Own Community Lunch Group

In 2009, when I was still active in my local Java community, I decided to start a monthly lunch group in my local area. I figured it would be enjoyable, educational, and I might make some connections that would be useful in my career.

More than anything else, it turned out to be the beginning of new friendships. We still meet. Many of us have moved on to other languages and activities, but the connection remains.

As a return on investment, the few minutes a month I spent getting us together was wildly successful. The great thing about lunches like this is that there is virtually no preparation involved. Nor is there any cost, other than the cost of your lunch.

Why do I bring this up? Because there have been many times when I've heard stories such as these:

1) My spouse had to move for her education/career so we moved to city X. I don't know anyone here. It's lonely and I miss the technical community I had before.

2) I'd really love to go the monthly meetups but I live far from them and due to the traffic it's not practical for me; and yet I would love to partake in some kind of technical community.

3) All the meetups are in the evening when I have take care of my children. Is there no way to meet my colleagues socially?
