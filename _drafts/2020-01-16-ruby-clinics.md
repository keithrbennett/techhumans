Information sharing at technical meetings consists almost exclusively of presentations. Although we all understand the value of having an expert share expertise with the rest of us, the cultural bias towards one-to-many communication results in many lost opportunities for cross-fertilization of knowledge and cultivation of connections among the group.

A many-to-many medium of communication such as a discussion or clinic provides an environment in which knowledge, ideas, and solutions can emanate from, and be received by, anyone.

I am not advocating _replacing_ presentations with discussions. Rather, I am advocating an optimal balance of the two. Where this optimal point falls will depend on the group.

We are all familiar with presentations, so I will mainly talk about discussions and clinics here, and what they offer that presentations do not. First I will talk about discussions in general, and then clinics in particular.


#### Multiple Sources of Information

It's rare that a single person possesses all the knowledge in the room. When anyone can speak, we are more likely to get higher quality information.


#### Dialog vs. Monologue

In a presentation, the information is assumed to be going in one direction, from the speaker to everyone else. Any discussion is normally for clarification of that unidirectional information flow.

In contrast, in a more conversational medium conducive to dialog, people 
are more likely to participate in the conversation, resulting in greater depth and breadth of the information flow, as ideas bounce from person to person.


#### Synergy

There is a synergy in discussions that is absent in presentations. In discussions, one person's answer can raise other questions or responses that can provide better information or lead the discussion to a valuable place that would not have otherwise been visited.


#### Community Development

People who may have not uttered a word in months of presentations can feel empowered to, and be encouraged to, speak in discussions, even if only to ask questions. The assumption of multiple participants encourages those other than the wizards of the group to offer their thoughts. From this interaction springs familiarity, and from familiarity springs friendship and community (not to mention jobs sometimes).


## Clinics, in Particular

The _clinic_ is a specialized form of discussion where people share their problems, challenges, and discoveries.

The key benefit of the clinic is that participants are likely to receive the information that is most valuable and helpful to them _at the time_. Also, the entire group is involved in finding the solution. For both of these reasons, clinics can be far more engaging than presentations.
 
Presentations, on the other hand, cover subjects that can be so specialized as to be irrelevant and uninteresting, and if they consume the entire meeting, new participants may not want to return. (I realize that this applies to my own presentations as well.) 

 
 
#### Structure

The clinic can be totally free form, but I recommend a meta-discussion at the beginning where people describe the topics they would like to discuss, and the group plans the discussion schedule. This is kind of like the opening of an open space conference but on a micro scale.


#### Infrastructure

It's helpful to have a shared screen. This is automatic if you are using collaboration software, but if you're in a physical room together, you'll need a projector or large shared monitor to be most productive.

You may have a single machine which will be shared by everyone. I recommend a wireless keyboard and mouse; it can easily be passed around for anyone to use.


#### Level of Effort

One of many great things about clinics is that they require zero preparation. Advance notice of questions can be helpful for those who wish to prepare, but it's not at all necessary.


#### Frequency

At minimum, clinics can be used as a fallback activity when unable to find a speaker. However, I would argue that having a clinic for part of every meeting would be valuable and interesting for most groups.


#### Duration

There is no real minimum time, nor a need for its own sake that the time be consistent from meeting to meeting. For example, if a meeting normally has two presentations, the clinic could be limited to fifteen minutes. If there is only one presentation, the clinic could be expanded to fill that time slot.

If people notify the group of issues in advance (e.g. on a Meetup page) then this duration could be adjusted accordingly.


#### Clinics for Dev Teams

Clinics aren't good only for meetups -- they can be even more valuable for development teams, where the participants' work share more in common.

## Counterpoints

Sometimes the one really does know more than all of the others.
Presentations have their place too, of course. This is the medium in which someone who has delved deeply into a subject can share knowledge

### My Ruby Clinic

A few years ago I was working at a network services company, among other things, writing software that could be used to more effectively test their products.

At the same time, they were automating their software testing to use Ruby and Cucumber. There were whole teams of software testers new to those technologies, and even programming in general. They were provided training, but after that training they were on their own.
 
They would sometimes come to me when stuck, and when they did, I dropped what I was doing. It felt great to help them, but I knew they needed more than just firefighting to be really productive. I was unable to get authorization for us to devote the time we needed for more intensive collaboration, so I scheduled weekly Ruby lunchtime "clinics" on our own time. People shared their challenges, questions, and conquests. We met in a meeting room with a large shared monitor. I brought an external keyboard and mouse with me for use by whomever was "driving". At the beginning we had a discussion of topics to cover. That gave me the information I needed to optimize the use of our hour together.

I encouraged them to show things they had learned, and to help each other.
