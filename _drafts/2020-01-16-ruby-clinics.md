Information sharing at tech meetups consists almost exclusively of presentations. While this can be valuable, the cultural bias towards one-to-many communication results in lost opportunities for cross-fertilization of knowledge and cultivation of connections among the group.

In contrast, a many-to-many medium of communication such as a discussion provides an environment in which knowledge, ideas, and solutions can emanate from, and be received by, anyone. 

#### Multiple Sources of Information

It's rare that a single person possesses all the knowledge in the room. When anyone can speak, we are more likely to get higher quality information.

#### Dialog vs. Monologue

In a presentation, the information is assumed to be going in one direction, from the speaker to everyone else. Any discussion is normally for clarification of that unidirectional information flow.

In contrast, in a more conversational medium conducive to dialog, people 
are more likely to participate in the conversation, resulting in greater depth and breadth of the information flow.

#### Synergy

There is a synergy in discussions that is absent in presentations. In discussions, one person's answer can raise other questions or responses that lead the discussion to a valuable place that would not have otherwise been visited.

## Clinics, in Particular

The "clinic" is a specialized form of discussion. It is a discussion where people bring their problems, challenges, and discoveries.

The key benefit of the clinic is that participants are likely to receive the information that is most valuable and helpful to them _at the time_. Presentations, on the other hand, often cover subjects that are esoteric, irrelevant, and/or too elementary or advanced for the audience member.

 
 
#### Structure

The clinic can be totally free form, but I recommend a meta-discussion at the beginning where people describe the topics they would like to discuss, and the group plans the discussion schedule. This is kind of like the opening of an open space conference but on a micro scale.

#### Infrastructure

It's helpful to have a shared screen. This is automatic if you are using collaboration software, but if you're in a physical room together, you'll need a projector or large shared monitor to be productive.

You may have a single machine which will be shared by everyone. I recommend a wireless keyboard and mouse; it can easily be passed around the table for anyone to use.

### My Ruby Clinic

A few years ago I was working at a network services company, among other things, writing software that could be used to more effectively test their products.

At the same time, they were automating their software testing to use Ruby and Cucumber. There were whole teams of software testers new to those technologies, and even programming in general. They were provided training, but after that training they were on their own.
 
They would sometimes come to me when stuck, and when they did, I dropped what I was doing. It felt great to help them, but I knew they needed more than just firefighting to be really productive. I was unable to get authorization for us to devote the time we needed for more intensive collaboration, so I scheduled weekly Ruby lunchtime "clinics" on our own time. People shared their challenges, questions, and conquests. We met in a meeting room with a large shared monitor. I brought an external keyboard and mouse with me for use by whomever was "driving". At the beginning we had a discussion of topics to cover. That gave me the information I needed to optimize the use of our hour together.

I encouraged them to show things they had learned, and to help each other.
